# GalCrash
Simulates galaxy mergers using Zelle Graphics. This was my final project for the class CS152 Computer Thinking: Science, using object-oriented programming and involving the creation of a GUI. This is an adaptation of Verkade’s Python replication of Mihos’ original “GalCrash” application in Java. Verkade uses PyQt, which is more appropriate for this simulation, but due to the parameters of my final project I adapted the program to Zelle Graphics instead. The GUI is functional and allows the initial state of galaxies to be created, but it does not as of yet create motion.
